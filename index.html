    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Joy Sherin. I am a sophomore who likes <strong>art</strong> and <strong>badminton</strong>. 
    After high school, I want to go on a vacation with my friends.  
    This page also explores concepts from <strong>Unit 1: Data</strong> and <strong>Unit 2: Computer Systems and Networks</strong>.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="unit1">
    <h2>Unit 1: Data</h2>
    <p><strong>bit:</strong> A binary digit, either 0 or 1.<br>
    <strong>byte:</strong> A sequence of 8 bits.<br>
    <strong>roundoff:</strong> Error that results when the number of bits is not enough to represent the number with full precision (like using 3 digits to represent as 3.14).<br>
    <strong>analog data:</strong> Values that change smoothly, rather than in discrete intervals, over time. For example, the pitch and volume of a live concert.<br>
    <strong>lossless:</strong> Compressing data in a way that preserves all data away and allows full recovery of the original.<br>
    <strong>lossy:</strong> Compressing data in a way that discards some data and makes it impossible to recover the original.<br>
    <strong>metadata:</strong> Data about data, like descriptive information about a file or a row in a database.</p>

    <h2>Unit 2: Computer Systems and Networks – Review</h2>
    <p><strong>Computing Device:</strong> A physical device that can run a program (e.g., computer, smartphone, smart sensor).<br>
    <strong>Computer Network:</strong> A group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data.<br>
    <strong>Path:</strong> The series of connections between computing devices on a network, starting with the sender and ending with the receiver.<br>
    <strong>Protocol:</strong> An agreed-upon set of rules that specify how systems behave and communicate.<br>
    <strong>Fault Tolerant:</strong> A system’s ability to continue functioning even if individual components fail.<br>
    <strong>Scalability:</strong> The ability of a system to expand or contract to meet new demands.<br>
    <strong>Bandwidth:</strong> The maximum transmission capacity of a system, measured by bit rate (bits per second).<br>
    <strong>URL (Uniform Resource Locator):</strong> An easy-to-remember web address (e.g., www.example.com).</p>

    <h3>Internet Structure and Layers</h3>
    <p><strong>Physical Network:</strong> The hardware and physical connections that carry internet signals.<br>
    <strong>Internet Protocol (IP):</strong> Assigns unique IP addresses to devices and determines how data is routed between them.<br>
    <strong>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):</strong> Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data packets.<br>
    <strong>User Datagram Protocol (UDP):</strong> A lightweight alternative to TCP with minimal error-checking (faster but less reliable).<br>
    <strong>Packets:</strong> Small chunks of data into which larger messages are divided for transmission. Packets may arrive in order, out of order, or not at all.<br>
    <strong>Routers:</strong> Specialized computers that forward data across networks, choosing the fastest available path.<br>
    <strong>Domain Name System (DNS):</strong> Translates human-readable domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses.<br>
    <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):</strong> Used for transmitting and requesting web pages and media on the World Wide Web.<br>
    <strong>World Wide Web (WWW):</strong> A system of linked pages, media, and files browsable over HTTP.</p>

    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
    <p><strong>Message Delivery on the Internet:</strong> Messages are split into packets, which may take different paths through the network. The internet does not require a direct connection between sender and receiver.<br>
    <strong>Redundancy:</strong> Multiple pathways exist in the network, so if one route fails, packets can take another.<br>
    <strong>Fault Tolerance:</strong> Because of redundancy, the internet can continue working even if parts of it are damaged.<br>
    <strong>Scalability:</strong> The internet is designed to grow and support billions of devices without redesigning its core structure.</p>

    <h3>IP Addressing and Encoding</h3>
    <p><strong>IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses → 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 unique addresses.<br>
    Adding 16 more bits (IPv6) increases the address space by 2^16 = 65,536 times.</strong></p>

   <section id="algorithms">
    <h2>Social Media Algorithms</h2>
    <p><strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> A type of algorithm designed to suggest content, products, or people you might like.  
    They look at your past behavior (what you clicked, watched, or bought) and compare it to other users with similar interests.<br>
    Not all posts show up first; the platforms rank them.  
    The <strong>content ranking</strong> decides the posts or videos you see.</p>
